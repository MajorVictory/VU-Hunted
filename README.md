# VU-Hunted

U.S. Spec-Ops team up to take down an unknown escaped Russian SCP

## Gameplay
- The US team must get 5 kills on the hunted to win.
- The RU team must kill 10 soldiers to win.
- Balance is best at 1 Hunted per 5 Soldiers

## List of Changes
- Best played on TDM Maps with very dark lighting
- US team always acts as the Soldiers
- RU team always acts as the Hunted
- Ammobag and Medicbag take longer to come back and have been reduced to a 1 meter radius
- Pistol damage has been increased (pistols have x3 damage, revolvers have x4 damage)
- T-UGS radar sweep is faster but takes longer to refill ammo

## Hunted
- Nightvision
- Knife
- M320 Smoke Launcher
- M1911 Silenced which fires MAV EMP bullets and can destroy Ammobags, Medicbags, C4, Claymores, and the T-UGS
- Super jump, slighty faster running speed and very fast crawl speed.
- Hold and remain crouching for 5 seconds to go invisible. Movement is very slow and you can still be shot.
